/**
 Configure the upload stream from which this request will read data to perform the upload.
 
 Assigning an input stream to a request will override the file or buffer previously set with `<setUploadFile:error:>` or
 `<setUploadData:withContentType:>`.
 
 If this method returns `YES`, the property `<upload>` will report `YES`.The `Content-Length` header will automatically
 be set as well, provided that *size* is greater than `0`.

 ### Unknown upload size/streaming uploads

 If you do not know the size of the upload beforehand, pass `0` as the *size* is `0`. Beware that by doing so, the
 `<uploadProgressBlock>` calls will pass back `0` for the *total* argument. This means that there will be no way for
 you to accurately calculate actual upload progress.
 
 @warning Passing `0` as *size* will cause the request to use chunked transfer encoding, even if you set
 `<chunkedTransfer>` to `NO`.
 
 Passing `0` is preferrable to passing a wrong value for *size*, as it may lead to incorrect request processing by the
 server.
 
 @param stream The input stream from which data will be read and sent as the upload body.
