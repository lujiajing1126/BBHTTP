/**
 The `BBHTTPExecutor` class is a request executor and queue manager that takes `<BBHTTPRequest>` instances and translates
 them for execution on the underlying libcurl infrastructure.
 
 It can be seen as a `NSOperationQueue` on which you enqueue operations &mdash; or, in this case, http requests.
 
 Given that each executor instance has little configuration and that configuration can safely be changed, using the 
 [singleton](<sharedExecutor>) is perfectly reasonable &mdash; encouraged, even.

 ### Request queuing and execution

 Whenever you submit a request, it will either be immediately executed or queued, depending on the number of active
 requests at the instant of submission.

 Submitted requests are strongly held (retain semantics) until their execution is terminated &mdash; either normally or
 abnormally &mdash; and the appropriate delegate blocks are called.

 At any time you may cancel a request. A queued request that is cancelled while still in the queue will remain in the 
 queue (with the `cancel` flag set to `YES`) until it is extracted for execution, at which point it is simply discarded.
 Assuming no other strong references to the request are kept, it will be `dealloc`'d at this time.

 ### libcurl handle pooling

 Each instance will create up to `<maxParallelRequests>` libcurl handles to execute requests, depending on number of
 parallel requests that may need to be performed. In other words, if you set the limit of libcurl handles to 3 but
 never execute more than one request at a time, the instance will only create and maintain a single handle.
 
 When all the handles are in use, request will be queued and executed later in time, in the first handle that frees up.
 
 ### libcurl handle setup
 
 Every time a request is executed, the handle is completely reconfigured and, upon termination, reset. This means that
 you can safely perform all sorts of requests to different hosts under the same `BBHTTPExecutor` instance.
